Welcome to the 6.819 Final Project

This project takes in black and white images and colors them using a convolutional neural network trained on a large database of images.

Setup

1. python miniplacesImgCollector.py

This file is used to combine all of the data from the miniplaces challenge dataset found at:
http://6.869.csail.mit.edu/fa16/project.html
into a single folder of images.

2. python imageResize.py

This command converts all images into size (160, 144) and then saves them into a new folder called in the main directory called new_pics.
The neural net is now ready to be trained using this collection of images.
